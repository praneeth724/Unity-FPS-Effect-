This repository contains a simple FPS (First Person Shooter) Unity game script that implements a basic shooting mechanic. The Gun script allows players to shoot bullets in the game, enhancing the gameplay experience.

## Features
- **Shooting Mechanic:** Players can shoot bullets using the Gun script.
- **Input Handling:** Utilizes the StarterAssetsInputs class for input handling.
- **Bullet Prefab:** Instantiates a bullet prefab at a specified point (bulletPoint).
- **Bullet Speed:** Bullets are launched forward with a set speed.

## How to Use
1. Attach the Gun script to your player or gun GameObject in Unity.
2. Assign the required GameObjects (bulletPrefab and bulletPoint) in the Unity Editor.
3. Ensure the StarterAssetsInputs class is correctly set up for input handling.
